    "\n",
    "To classify messages as spam or non-spam, we know that the computer:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Learns how humans classify messages.\n",
    "- Uses that human knowledge to estimate probabilities for new messages - probabilities for spam and non-spam.\n",
    "- Classifies a new message based on these probability values - if the probability for spam is greater, then it classifies the message as spam.  Otherwise, it classifies it as non-spam (if the two probability values are equal, then we may need a human to classify the message).\n",
    "\n",
    "Our first task is to \"teach\" the computer how to classify messages.  To do that, we'll use the multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm along with a dataset of 5,572 SMS messages that are already classified by humans."
